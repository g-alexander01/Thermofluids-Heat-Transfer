##
# Key info:
# - Heat transfer occours through 3 mechanisms - conduction, convection, and radiation
# - Main interest lies in the external walls, windows, roof and ground floor (contact with outside world)
# - Therfore internal walls and floors will not be considered in calculation as house temp is homogeneous
